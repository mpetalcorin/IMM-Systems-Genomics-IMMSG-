# Model Card: IMM Systems Genomics (IMMSG)A transparent, module-based systems-genomics model that infers **inner mitochondrial membrane** system states (coupling vs leak/stress) from expression data using rank-based scoring and network structure.## Model details**Model type:** Systems-genomics scoring and network inference pipeline  **Primary outputs:** Module activity scores, composite coupling indices, differential statistics, latent axes (PCA/NMF), partial-correlation networks, hypergraph visualizations, bootstrap stability  **Intended scope:** Bulk transcriptomic datasets (TPM/CPM/count-like), with curated IMM gene modules.## Motivation and intended useIMMSG is intended to:- Provide interpretable **module-level** IMM readouts (ETC, ATP synthase, cristae, transport, leak)- Support hypothesis generation about **coupling integrity** versus **uncoupling/leak** states- Identify robust module signatures using **bootstrap stability**- Reveal cross-module relationships using **partial correlations**## Inputs- Expression matrix (genes x samples), non-negative units recommended- Metadata with a two-class group label for default hypothesis tests## OutputsTables written to `outputs_immsg/tables/`:- `module_scores_auc.csv` (core module activity matrix)- `composite_scores.csv` (Coupling Integrity, Leak/Uncoupling)- `diff_module_activity.csv` (module-level t-test + FDR)- `diff_expression_IMM_genes.csv` (IMM gene DE + FDR)- `pca_loadings.csv`, `pca_variance.csv` (latent structure)- `nmf_loadings.csv` (additive IMM programs)- `module_partial_corr_edges.csv` (conditional dependency edges)- `summary.json` (compact summary)Figures are rendered inline in notebooks and may be saved optionally.## Technical summary1. **Rank-based scoring:** within each sample, genes are ranked and each module’s score is the mean rank percentile of its genes (AUC-like).2. **Composite indices:** weighted combinations of modules create Coupling Integrity and Leak/Uncoupling indices.3. **Differential tests:** Welch’s t-tests compare module scores and curated IMM genes between two groups, with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR.4. **Latent axes:** PCA and NMF compress module activities into low-dimensional system programs.5. **Network inference:** Graphical Lasso estimates a sparse inverse covariance; converted to partial correlations to infer conditional dependencies.6. **Robustness:** bootstrap resampling estimates stability of module differences.## Performance characteristicsThis is not a predictive classifier by default; it is an **interpretable scoring** and **structure inference** workflow.“Performance” is assessed through:- statistical separation of groups,- effect sizes,- stability under bootstrap,- consistency across multiple views (PCA, network, hypergraph).## Ethical considerations- Outputs can influence biological interpretation; they should be treated as **hypothesis-generating**.- Transcript-level differences do not necessarily imply protein-level or functional changes.- If applied to clinical data, follow local governance for privacy and consent.## Limitations- Default differential tests assume exactly two groups; multi-group designs require linear models.- Results depend on the quality of expression normalization and sample metadata.- Conditional-dependency networks infer statistical structure, not causality.## Recommendations for responsible use- Validate key conclusions using orthogonal assays (respiration, membrane potential, ATP flux, proteomics, imaging).- Include covariates (batch, cell-type composition) when possible.- Report bootstrap stability alongside p-values to avoid fragile claims.
